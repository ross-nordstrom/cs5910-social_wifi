\subsection{CoovaAP Setup}
The CoovaAP setup was fairly straight-forward. As mentioned in the proposal, I used a Linksys
WRT54GL \cite{product:WRT54GL} with the corresponding CoovaAP binary, available on their public
website \cite{product:CoovaAPBin}. After the firmware was installed (by using the router's
existing Firmware Update page), I had access to CoovaAP. I found that the Coova software was very
flaky, and I had to reset the router multiple times to get any content on the Admin pages, such as
the ability to configure it, or to setup a Hotspot.
