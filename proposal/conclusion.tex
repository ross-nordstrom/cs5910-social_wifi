\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
I set out to investigate how to make wireless networks more secure by taking an improved ease-of-use
approach by integrating network authentication with OAuth. What I found was a free-to-use captive
portal implementation called CoovaAP. CoovaAP had an existing Facebook integration, but it was not
maintained and no longer works with modern Facebook. What it did offer me was a relatively easy way
to install firmware with an instrumented captive portal. In all, I learned about current and
historic wireless network authentication and security protocols as well gaining a deeper knowledge
of OAuth.

After conducting the investigation I did, I think there is value in integrating wireless network
authentication with a popular, open, and extensible protocol like OAuth. As discussed in the Future
Work section \ref{section:futurework}, the focus of any research furthering this area will need to
focus ease of use, supporting multiple providers, and marketing awareness of the concept.
