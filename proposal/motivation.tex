\section{Motivation}
\label{section:motivation}
Existing WiFi authentication mechanisms, while technically secure, tend to create a poor user
experience and become vulnerable because of unpredictable behaviors of the users. Additionally,
most methods of authentication make it difficult for an administrator to revoke access to the
network, or even see who and what has access to begin with.

\subsection{
WiFi authentication typically works based on the sharing of an SSID and a secret or password.
This works, and allows for secure communication between a device who has the SSID/secret and
the wireless router or access point. The challenge with this "shared secret" technique is it
can be tedious to share with users. Additionally, to improve the security of a shared secret,
it should be (1) hard to guess and therefore a mixture of alphanumeric and special characters,
(2) hard to brute force and therefore long enough to challenge current and near-future computers,
and (3) is changed regularly reducing the window of opportunity intruders have on the network.
