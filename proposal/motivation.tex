\section{Motivation}
\label{section:motivation}
Existing WiFi authentication mechanisms, while technically secure, tend to create a poor user
experience and become vulnerable because of unpredictable behaviors of the users. Additionally,
most methods of authentication make it difficult for an administrator to revoke access to the
network, or even see who and what has access to begin with.

\subsection{Authentication Types}
There are several authentication techniques supported for communication over WiFi. They include
the following types of authentication, roughly in ascending order of security and grouped by security:
 \cite{WifiAuthenticationTypes} \cite{wiki:WirelessSecurity}

\subsubsection{Insecure Types}
\begin{description}
  \item{SSID Hiding:} Wireless networks can be "hidden" by not broadcasting the SSID; however,
  it's extremely easy to detect hidden SSIDs. This is a "security through obscurity" technique,
  which does a poor job of providing protection.
  \item{Open WEP Authentication:} Devices must have a Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) key matching
  the access point's WEP keys. These keys must be pre-shared, and any authenticated device can
  immediately authenticate with the access point. Use of WEP has been deprecated since 2004 and has
  been shown to be insecure.
  \item{Shared-Key WEP Authentication:} Similarly, devices have a shared key, but now must
  authenticate in through a four-step handashake. The device sends a request to the access point,
  who responds with an unencrypted challenge text, which the device encrypts using the shared key
  and returns to the AP. Finally, the access point decrypts the device's response and returns it.
  This technique is actually less secure than Open WEP Authentication, but intruders can see both
  the clear and encrypted text, and therefore derive the shared key. Once derived, they could use
  the shared key for uninhibited access to the wireless network.
  \item{MAC Address Authentication:} An access point can be configured with a white-list of allowed
  device MAC addresses. Any device with a MAC address on that list can communicate over the network.
  Authentication by MAC address is problematice for a couple reasons. First, it is onerous on the
  system administrator to have to manage the list of allowed MAC addresses, especially at scale.
  Secondly, it is actually pretty easy to spoof MAC addresses. An intruder simply needs to eavesdrop
  on a successful authentication, and then assume that device's MAC address.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Secure Types}
\begin{description}
  \item{WPA Authentication:} WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a successor to WEP, addressing the
  vulnerabilities of WEP that introduced insecurities. Specifically, it uses TKIP (Temporal Key
  Integrity Protocol) to dynamically use a new key for each packet after initial authentication.
  Additionally it replaces WEP's use of CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) with Michael for better packet
  integrity verification. For all that, WPA suffers from two main vulnerabilities: (1) users can
  choose to use insecure secrets, and (2) can be bypassed through Wi-Fi Protected Setup.

  WPA comes in two primary types: WPA-Personal (or WPA-PSK, pre-shared key) and WPA-Enterprise. They
  have different requirements and target audiences: \cite{wiki:WPA}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{WPA-Personal:} Intended for residential and small office networks. All devices authenticate
  with the same key. Also called "WPA-PSK".
  \item{WPA-Enterprise:} Intended for enterprise networks, required a RADIUS authentication server.
  It uses EAP for authentication. Also called "WPA-802.1X mode" or "WPA".
  \end{itemize}

  \item{WPA2:} Replaces WPA with the major contribution being CCMP, a stronger AES-based encryption.
  CCMP stands for "Counter Cipher Mode with block chaining message authentication code Protocol".

  \item{EAP Authentication:} The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defines a set of
  interactions between the device and a RADIUS authentication server, with the access point
  relaying. Once authenticated, the device gets a unique key for continued authenticated access. It
  comes in a variety of types, with the most prominent being the PEAP (Protected EAP), and
  \textbf{insecure} LEAP (Lightweight EAP).

  \item{RF Shielding:} Rather than worry about intruders gaining unauthorized access to the network,
  it can be simpler to coat the surrounding structure (e.g. room, office space, or building) with
  a material, film, or paint that prevents wireless signals from entering or escaping.

  \item{Token Identifiers:} Smart cards and USB/Software Tokens can be used for one of the most
  secure authentication mechisms. The token provider (card, USB, or software) combines a stored
  token with a user-entered PIN in a time-sensitive algorithm to frequently produce new encryption
  codes. Authentication with the server requires the device to be synchronized with its clock.
\end{description}

\subsection{Shared Keys}
WiFi authentication typically works based on the sharing of an SSID and a secret or password.
This works, and allows for secure communication between a device who has the SSID/secret and
the wireless router or access point. The challenge with this shared secret technique is it
can be tedious to share with users. Additionally, to improve the security of a shared secret,
it should be (1) hard to guess and therefore a mixture of alphanumeric and special characters,
(2) hard to brute force and therefore long enough to challenge current and (near-) future computers,
and (3) is changed regularly reducing the window of opportunity intruders have on the network.
