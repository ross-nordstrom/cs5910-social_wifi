Secure wireless authentication is a critical problem to solve well. The global trend is for
increased network usage and complexity, and within networks a growth in the use of wireless. With
such importance there are a number of works exploring ways to improve wireless security, but very
few focusing on how to improve the experience for residential and small networks. The most similar
work I could find is by Coova \cite{product:CoovaAP}.

\subsubsection{CoovaAP}
CoovaAP aims to solve similar problems to what I set out to accomplish. At its core, it has
a lot of overlap with my goal; however, it is a relatively inactive project and I had difficulty
setting it up to compare what it does to what I aim to implement.

CoovaAP is an OpenWRT-based firmware designed especially for HotSpots. It comes with the CoovaChilli access controller built-in and makes it easily configurable. \cite{product:CoovaAP}

CoovaAP includes ChilliSpot, Coova's captive portal solution, and some built-in solutions for
creating a HotSpot with authentication based on checking a terms of service link, Facebook
integration.
